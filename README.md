# Hoppelpoppel - wo bist du

This is a tiny little private project on a children's story about a little boy, his dearly beloved black plush dog and a loving father. The short story "Hoppelpoppel - wo bist du" was written about a hundred years ago by my favourite novelist and writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Fallada">Hans Fallada</a>.

I "scraped" the story from https://www.projekt-gutenberg.org/fallada/hoppelpo/hoppelpo.html and prepared the data for text analytics and visualizations with Tableau.

The Tableau visualization is here and public at: https://public.tableau.com/profile/diana.jaffe#!/vizhome/Hoppelpoppel/Animated .
